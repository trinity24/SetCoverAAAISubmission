# SetCover

## Datasets

#### To generate synthetic dataset with varying frequencies $f \in ${3,4,...,10}  values, use the function `generate_dataset()` in  `./notebooks/setcover_dataset.py` with parameters as 
` num_instances=100, n=200, d=5, k1=50, k2=40, k3=40, f, num_subsets=500` 




## Synthetic Datsets 
### To generate the plots (Approximation Factor, Fairness Violations) for Inamdar Rounding vs Fair Iterated Rounding, run the notebook notebooks/synthetic_exps.ipynb



## Real-world Datasets
### To generate the plots for Inamdar Rounding vs Fair Iterated Roudning, run the notebook notebooks/realword_exps.ipynb
